## üí° Tips for Success

### Development Best Practices
1. **Test Early and Often**: Don't wait until the end to test functionality
2. **Follow MVC Patterns**: Keep controllers thin, models focused, views clean
3. **Use Version Control**: Regular commits help track progress
4. **Validate Input**: Always validate user input on both client and server
5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide meaningful error messages to users

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Missing Migrations**: Always run migrations after model changes
- **Broken Authentication**: Test login/logout thoroughly
- **Inconsistent Theming**: Apply theme consistently across all pages
- **Poor Validation**: Don't rely only on client-side validation
- **Security Issues**: Never trust user input without validation

### Getting Help
- **Read Documentation**: README.md contains detailed setup instructions
- **Check Error Messages**: Browser developer tools show helpful error info
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask instructor for clarification
- **Peer Discussion**: Collaborate with classmates on concepts (not code)
